# Dataset Documentation: Pipeline Conflict Detection

The dataset contains synthetic data generated for the purpose of pipeline conflict detection in a processor. The dataset is designed to aid in the development and evaluation of machine learning models for identifying pipeline conflicts in instruction sequences.

The dataset consists of three columns:

Instruction 1: This column represents the first instruction in an instruction sequence. It contains the textual representation of the instruction, following the assembly language format. Instructions are represented as strings and include operations such as arithmetic operations (e.g., ADD, SUB), memory operations (e.g., LOAD, STORE), logical operations (e.g., AND, OR), and shifts (e.g., SHIFT). The operands of the instructions are registers (R0, R1, etc.) and immediate values.

Instruction 2: This column represents the subsequent instruction in the instruction sequence. It follows the same format as Instruction 1 and represents the instruction that has a potential data hazard with Instruction 1. The data hazard can be of three types: Read-after-Write (RAW), Write-after-Read (WAR), or Write-after-Write (WAW).

Hazard Type: This column represents the type of data hazard present between Instruction 1 and Instruction 2. It specifies whether the pair of instructions exhibits a RAW, WAR, WAW hazard, or no conflict.

The dataset includes synthetic samples for each type of data hazard as well as instances with no conflicts. Random values are generated for registers and immediate values to introduce variations and randomness in the data.

The dataset is suitable for machine learning tasks focused on pipeline conflict detection, such as binary classification or multi-class classification. It can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models to predict the presence of data hazards in instruction sequences.

Note: The dataset is synthetic and generated based on predefined rules. It does not represent real-world data and should be used for educational or research purposes.
